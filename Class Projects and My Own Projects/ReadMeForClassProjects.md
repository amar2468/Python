This is a readme file for the class projects


The python projects that I did in class are:

1. DocumentRetrieval.py
2. ConvertingCurrencies.py
3. ShoppingOnline.py

The first project was a project that allows the user to enter two words they wish to find. Then, the program finds where the words are, i.e. in which documents they are in. Then, you can find the document to read. This project works in a similar way like Google, although in a much more simplistic way. The similar things would definitely be the ability to search for words and find the exact places where these words occur. This project, if further improved, can be an extremely useful project that allows for seaching of various things.

The second project was ConvertingCurrencies.py. This project introduced me into APIs. After doing this project, I definitely want to research on APIs and find ways the build powerful programs. The program allows the user to pass a currency and then, the program converts the currency into the type of currency the user chooses. This project will definitely be vastly improved in the coming weeks and months.

The third project is the ShoppingOnline.py one. When you go to an online shop, you can purchase items by choosing the item and putting them in the so called "basket". The project that I coded up does exactly this. The user is presented with a list of products. The user chooses the product they want. The user can remove a product if they decide not to buy it. The user can checkout and they are presented with the total they must pay. This project was very good because it got me to practice on working with classes. This is an extremely important part of OOP. This project helped me understand OOP because I created relationships such as inheritance and aggregation.

After doing all the above projects, I acquired knowledge of the fundamental aspects of python. This helped me later on when I started doing some of my own coding projects. I am still working on my own coding projects but these projects that I did helped me build the infrastructure.
