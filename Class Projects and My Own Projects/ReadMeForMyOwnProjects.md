This is the readme file which contains information about my own coding projects in python.

The coding projects that I created are:
1. TextBasedAdventure.py
2. FunGames.py
3. ContactBook.py

The first mini-project is the TextBasedAdventure.py. This was a fun way of using my programming knowledge to create something that is both funny and easy to create. This game would be really good for small kids who have just started playing very easy games. The game allows the user the chance to either survive or die. If they pick an incorrect option from a numerous amount of options, they can potentially die or survive. This isn't such a hard project to complete but it is fun to code these kinds of games! More information on the project can be found in the documentation readme file.

The second project (FunGames.py) is a project that consists of three classes: Registration, GuessingNumberGame and RockPaperScissors. Also, these classes had numerous methods and every method had a specific task to execute. This made completing the project easier because you could split the project into parts that are easier to complete, rather than doing it without methods and classes. The registration class creates an account for the user. Then, the user can choose whether they want to play the guessing game or the rock paper scissors game. The user can win a prize if they win the game. Detailed documentation on the project can be found in the readme file of the project.


The third project I wish to discuss briefly is called (ContactBook.py). This project is still being developed so there are many more changes and developments taking place. This project is similar to a contact book on a phone. You add a contact or you can view a contact and you can also delete a contact. This app/program allows the user to create their own account and then add their favourite contacts so that they can contact them when needed. The user has the ability to log on and to log off and there are certain error checking mechanisms which prevent the user to do incorrect actions (log off without even logging in is an example of an action which would be incorrect). More information about the project can be found in the project documentation readme file.
