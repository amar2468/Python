# PROJECT NAME - DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL 
# Author: Amar Plakalo
# The document-retrieval.py file is a simple program that works similar to a web search engine. The only difference is that it is much more simpler than a web search engine.
# ap_docs.txt file is filled with documents that are separated by a <NEW DOCUMENT> token
# The aim of this program is for the user to enter two words and the program will look for where these words are located i.e. in which documents.
# The program has three options: 
#                                1. Search for Documents
#                                2. Read Documents
#                                3. Quit Program
# The first option asks the user to enter two words that they wish to look for. The program then identifies where these words are located i.e. which documents.
# Sets are used for these two words and then an intersection set is used to find the common documents between the two words.
# Option 2 asks the user which document they wish to see. The user enters the document and it is presented to the user to see.
# Option 3 is if the user wishes to exit the program. A thank you message is printed and the program ends.
